  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Magento Community Edition, the [Magento User
  Guide](http://www.magentocommerce.com/resources/user-guide-download) will
  step you through the process of configuring and managing your store. This
  guide is free, but does require you to provide a valid email address to
  receive it.

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  The [Magento Forum](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/) provides a place
  to get answers to both simple and advanced questions regarding configuration
  and management of Magento Community Edition.

  #### Logging into Magento
  To login, go to the URL listed above in a browser. If your DNS is not
  pointing to this installation, you can add a line in your [hosts
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  to point your domain to the IP of this Cloud Server. Once you've done this,
  restart your browser and navigate to the site. The backend can be accessed using the
  "Magento Admin URL" listed in Stack Details, and you can login with the credentials
  provided in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  To update or upload code, you can log in as the 'magento' user via SSH or SFTP into the 'httpdocs' folder. 
  The password is provided n the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.
  
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH, which should be used for configuration changes only. 
  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).  Once
  the deployment is up, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) is used as the web server and listens on port
  80 to handle web traffic. The configuration for your site can be
  found in /etc/nginx/conf.d/. There will be a default site
  configuration and a separate one for your domain. Magento itself is
  installed in /var/www/vhosts. You will find a directory with the name of
  website you entered as a part of this deployment.

  [PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) is used to handle
  evaluation of all PHP-based pages. The configuration for this installation is
  based on the URL of your site, and can be found within  /etc/php5/fpm/pools/yoursite.conf.
  By default, PHP-FPM is running as the 'magento' user, listens on 127.0.0.1:9001.

  Object and session caching are handled by
  [Redis](http://redis.io/). Redis is an in-memory, high performance key-value
  and is used for caching data and persisting user session data. This enhances
  the performance of your site by reducing expensive database calls. Three caches
  are configured: two for data caching and one for session persistence. You can
  find the configuration of these caches in /etc/redis/.

  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Master server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The Master server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the Master server and restore the Holland backup
  to the Cloud Database via the MySQL client.  For more assistance, please
  contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that Nginx is running on both the Master
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.
  
  ### Notes for multi-server deployments
  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the Master server to all secondary servers.
  When uploading content, it only needs to be uploaded to the Master node,
  and will be automatically synchronized to all secondary nodes.
  
  You will need to make sure your Magento Dashboard is served only from the
  Master server, so that image uploads will be synchronsed to the secondary
  servers with Lsyncd.  
  1. First, create a DNS subdomain such as "admin.example.com" which should point at the public IP of the Master server. 
  2. Then, log into the Magento dashboard and go to System > Configuration > Admin
  3. Under "Admin base URL", select "Use Custom Admin URL" = Yes, and enter http://admin.example.com/ 
  4. Be sure to include the trailing slash, changing 
  5. If you wish to use SSL for the Magento dashboard (recommended), please ensure your SSL certificate is installed on the Master server, and Nginx is configured to use it on port 443, _before_ you change the Admin URL to an https:// URL.  
   
  ### SSL Certificates
  Using SSL is highly recommended. You can enable SSL by uploading your certificate
  to the Cloud Load Balancer, which is configurable under Network -> Cloud Load Balancers. 
  Once it is set up, you can set your Frontend and Admin use https:// base URLs. 
  Please call Support for further guidance, or if your actions lead to broken or looping redirects. 

  #### Magento Plugins
  There are thousands of plugins that have been developed for Magento by the
  developer community. [Magento
  Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/) provides an easy
  way to discover popular plugins that other users have found to be helpful.
  Not all plugins are free, and we recommend only installing the plugins that
  you need.

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack.  This deployment is
  intended for low to medium traffic production websites and can be
  scaled as needed to accommodate future growth.

  When scaling this deployment by adjusting the "server_count" parameter,
  make sure that you DO NOT change the "database_flavor" and "database_disk"
  parameters, as this will result in the loss of all data within the
  database.

  ## Important security notes
  The Magento code provided here is the latest at time of deployment, but Magento does *not* auto-update. 
  You, or your development team, are responsible for applying any and all future Magento security patches to keep your site secure. 
  For awareness, we would highly recommend signing up to recieve security alerts at https://magento.com/security
